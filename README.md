# KFold-cross-validation-with-R
Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. That k-fold cross validation is a procedure used to estimate the skill of the model on new data. I have used the swiss and mtcars datasets to predict the performance of various models like Linear regression , Decision trees , Random forest , Cforest , treebag.
